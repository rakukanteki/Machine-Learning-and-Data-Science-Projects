# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains simple Machine Learning and Data Science Projects.

## Tools used:
- Python Programming Language.
- Pandas for Data Cleaning.
- MatPlotlib for data visualisation.
- Python Flask for Backend server.
- HTML, CSS for UI and JS for communicating with server.
- Kaggle for Datasets
- Supervised Machine Learning.

## Features:
In these projects we will go through some cool features of Data Science. Like,
1) Feature Engineering.
2) Data Cleaning.
3) One Hot Encoding
4) Outlier Detection.
5) Dimensionality Reduction.

## New concepts learned:
1) What is Python Flask Server.
   - Consumes pickle files.
   - This server expose HTTP endpoints for various requests And UI made by HTML, CSS, JS will make
     HTTP get and post calls.
2) Data Cleaning Process.
3) Feature Engineering.
4) Creating JSON File.
5) Python Flask
6) HTTP GET and HTTP POST
7) API Testing. [ Using Postman ( https://www.postman.com/ ) ]
8) Deploying project to production AWS ( Amazon EC2 instance )
