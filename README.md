# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains simple Machine Learning and Data Science Projects.

## Tools used:
- Python Programming Language.
- Pandas for Data Cleaning.
- MatPlotlib for data visualisation.
- Python Flask for Backend server.
- HTML, CSS, JS for UI.
- Kaggle for Datasets
- Supervised Machine Learning.

## Features:
In these projects we will go through some cool features of Data Science. Like,
1) Feature Engineering.
2) Data Cleaning.
3) One Hot Encoding
4) Outlier Detection.
5) Dimensionality Reduction.

## New concepts exlopred:
1) What is Python Flask Server.
   - Consumes pickle files.
   - This server expose HTTP endpoints for various requests And UI made by HTML, CSS, JS will make
     HTTP get and post calls.
2)
